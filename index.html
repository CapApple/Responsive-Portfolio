                        <p> I am a next-door type guy with too many hobbies, according to my friends. They are right. I
                            love traveling, biking, skiing, climbing, diving, board game, photography and film making. And
                            last but not least, I love bad jokes too! Among my numerous hobbies, Iâ€™m really serious about
                            photography and filmmaking. Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan are two of my favorite
                            directors. I have made a few short films and commercials, but I have always been dreaming about
                            making a feature film someday.</p>
                        <P> I have a keen eye for those little beautiful details and moments in life. And I enjoy seeing
                            them and realizing that life is good. That's why you can see me carrying my camera with me in a
                            lot of occasions, even on a Sunday coffe trip to downtown. I don't just photogrpah landscape, I
                            photogrpah people too, and I am good at posing others. However, I really suck at smiling when I
                            am on the other side of the camera.</P>
                        <p> I have a background in Electrical Engineering and Accounting, and I had fun. So why am I here
                            now studing web developing? Well, that's a long story. But I do believe that life is too short
                            to not live to its fullest. And by far, I have been enjoying every bit of this journey. So wish
                            me luck!</p>
